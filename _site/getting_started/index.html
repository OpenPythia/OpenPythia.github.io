        <h1>Getting Started with OpenPythia</h1>

<div class="explanation-row">
    <p>OpenPythia is started by double clicking on the jar file. When starting it for the first time, it asks you to
        provide
        a JDBC driver. As Oracle has a restrictive policy for this driver, it could not be integrated into OpenPythia –
        sorry. Click on the button Load JDBC driver and choose the appropriate driver.</p>

    <p>You can download the driver from the <a
            href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/jdbc-112010-090769.html">Oracle
        Technology Network</a>.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/GettingStarted_01_LoadJDBCDriver.png">
    </figure>
</div>

<hr class="explanation-divider">

<div class="explanation-row">
    <p>On the next screen you have to provide the information into which schema OpenPythia should log in. As a first
        time user you don’t have an appropriate schema – so you have to create one. Choose the menu item
        <kbd>Tools <span
                class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right small"></span> Create schema</kbd> creation script and save the
        file. Hand this file to your database administrator – perhaps yourself when you try it on a developer database –
        and let it be executed.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="../images/GettingStarted_02_LoginEmpty.png">
    </figure>

    <p>For this Getting Started we have chosen a local XE database. In this case log in as SYS and execute the
        script.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/GettingStarted_02_LoginLocalXE.png">
    </figure>

    <p>Now provide the connection information. If you haven’t changed the script, the password of the user
        <code>pythia</code> is <code>pythia</code>.
        Press the button <kbd>Connect</kbd> to connect OpenPythia to the database.</p>

</div>

<hr class="explanation-divider">

<div class="explanation-row">

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/GettingStarted_03_StartScreen.png">
    </figure>

    <p>After a few seconds you will see the first information on the database. Press the button <kbd>Details</kbd> to
        get to the full blown version of the dialog.</p>
    <p>Next you need to take a snapshot off the SQL statements in the library cache: Press the button <kbd>Take
        Snapshot</kbd>.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/GettingStarted_04_BigScreenEmpty.png">
    </figure>
</div>

<hr class="explanation-divider">

<div class="explanation-row">

    <p>Now it is time to have a coffee: Give the database some minutes to do its work before you take the second
        snapshot by pressing the button <kbd>Take Snapshot</kbd> a second time.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/GettingStarted_05_BigScreenTwoSnapshots.png">
    </figure>


</div>

<hr class="explanation-divider">

<div class="explanation-row">
    <p>Now that you have two snapshots, OpenPythia can compare these snapshots to tell you what happened on the database
        in the meantime. Choose both snapshots and press the button <kbd>Compare Snapshots &hellip;</kbd></p>
    <p>The lower part of the dialog is filled with the results of the comparison.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/GettingStarted_06_BigScreenCompared.png">
    </figure>

</div>

<hr class="explanation-divider">

<div class="explanation-row">
    <p>The lower part of the dialog gives you a first impression of what happened – but it isn’t very comfortable to
        use. Press the button <kbd>Export to Excel</kbd> to get an Excel file containing all the information needed to
        analyze the database.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/GettingStarted_07_ExcelOverview.png">
    </figure>

    <p>The SQL statements are sorted by descending total elapsed time: During several years of doing fire fight projects
        to improve database performance, most time the worst statements were those with the highest total elapsed
        time.</p>

    <p>When looking at this example you easily spot the problem: The first statement was executed more than 30thousand
        times in five minutes.</p>

</div>

<hr class="explanation-divider">

<div class="explanation-row">

    <p>Even though to many calls are often found in real world scenarios, most times you would like to have a closer
        look on the statements with a high total elapsed time. The first statement has a blue X in the column Plan (E).
        If you click on it, you will see the execution plan of this statement. The execution plan is the one really used
        – and maybe different from the one you get when executing explain plan. This is very important when you have to
        find the root cause of performance problems in your productive system.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/GettingStarted_08_ExcelExecutionPlan.png">
    </figure>

</div>

<hr class="explanation-divider">

<div class="explanation-row">
    <p>Another way to look at a statement is via the wait events associated with it. Those statements have a blue X in
        the column Wait (F). The following example is from a productive database.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/GettingStarted_09_ExcelWaitPerStatement.png">
    </figure>

</div>

<hr class="explanation-divider">

<div class="explanation-row">
    <p>The currently last way to look at the performance is to have a look at all wait events. To see the list you have
        to change to the sheet <kbd>All Wait Events</kbd>. Here you find an overview on all the wait events which occurred between
        the two snapshots on which the report is based. </p>
